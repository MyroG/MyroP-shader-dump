![Showcase](https://github.com/MyroG/MyroP-shader-dump/blob/master/SomnaGlass/Doc/settings.png)

The shader has two parralax layers : Foreground and background.
Each layer can be customized with the "color", "scroll speed", "distance" and "animation speed" settings.

Glass color : Here you can change the glass color. To made the glass more or less transparent, you can play around with the alpha value
Somna Edge Fade : Makes the parralax effect more transparent around the edgeys
Somna Camera Distance fade : Makes the parralax effect dissapear when you're further away
Fresnel : It's a rim light effect
Lastly, there are also autioLink related settings.

For optimal result, do not compress the "SomnaPattern" texture.
I would recommend playing around with each setting to see what each setting really does!
