## Shaders made by MyroP

Feel free to check out each folder to see the documentation of each of them, the "ASEFunctions" folder only contains a few Amplify functions I've been using for a few of my shaders, it can be ignored.

## License

You can find a license file in each shader folder.
If no license file is provided, then the shader is licensed under the MIT license.
