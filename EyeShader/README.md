## Installation

- Install LTCGI https://github.com/PiMaker/ltcgi
- Install AudioLink via the VCC package manager

## Settings

MainTex : The main eye texture, use whatever texture you want

Video player settings, only works with ProTV 3.0 for now :
- Emissive : Basically how the video texture should be shown on the eyes, it works like a mask, that's why the included "emissiveEye" has such a high contrast.
- Video Intensity : How strong the emissive effect should be, make sure to set it to at least 1, otherwise the video screen effect won't be visible.

Lastly, there are two settings to customize the flow speed and strength : Flow Speed and Flow strength.

## Testing

Only works with ProTV 3.0, but here are a few worlds you can check out to test that shader :
